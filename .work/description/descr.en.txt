Extension for Extensions Developers.

Use shortcut (Alt-Z by default) or context menu on any tab to reload enabled unpacked extensions.

Pros:

- Quick reload with context menu or shortcut (Alt-Z by default but you can change.  See Options page for instructions)
- Reload only enabled extensions
- If Options page is open also restart it
- Ability to reload active tab (see Options page). It useful for content script extensions development.
- Ability to turn off reload from context menu (see Options page)

Contras:

- It closes the background debugger window. No public API to reopen :(
